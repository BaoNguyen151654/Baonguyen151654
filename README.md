### 🚀 DATA SCIENTIST | AI RESEARCHER | DATA ENGINEER

Oops, what are you doing here? Anyway, welcome to my portfolio.
Here you’ll find a collection of projects I’ve worked on, some challenging,
some frustrating, but all meaningful.  
Yes, a few of them were completed while I was staring at my screen at 3 a.m 😀.

**About Me:** I am Bao Nguyen, a graduate student in Data Science and Analytics with over two years of experience in machine learning, working as a researcher and AI trainer. My skill set spans Data Science, Data Engineering, and AI Engineering, with a strong focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Business Intelligence (BI).

### 🔬 PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

<p align="center"><strong>| RESEARCH IMPLEMENTATION: SPATIOTEMPORAL TRANSFORMERS FOR SIGN LANGUAGE PRODUCTION |
</strong></p>

</p>

**Description:**
This project aims to overcome language barriers for the Deaf community. 
I built a Spatiotemporal Transformer model from scratch that translates text into sign language. 
The model was trained and tested on the PHOENIX-14 dataset, a well-known dataset for German Sign Language. 
Temporal and spatial attention in the decoder enables the model to capture both dimensions effectively, 
achieving a normalized DTW score of 0.49, which is a 91.4% improvement over traditional Transformer models on the same dataset.

</p>

**Description:**
This project focuses on building a database for an online bike shop. 
The MySQL database is connected to the shop's website to process real-time transactions. 
In addition, I performed data analytics and machine learning by extracting features from this dataset 
to generate recommendations for optimizing business solutions.
