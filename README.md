### 🔬 PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

<p align="center"><strong>| RESEARCH IMPLEMENTATION: SPATIOTEMPORAL TRANSFORMERS FOR SIGN LANGUAGE PRODUCTION |
</strong></p>

<p align="center">

</p>

**Description:**
This project aims to overcome language barriers for the Deaf community. 
I built a Spatiotemporal Transformer model from scratch that translates text into sign language. 
The model was trained and tested on the PHOENIX-14 dataset, a well-known dataset for German Sign Language. 
Temporal and spatial attention in the decoder enables the model to capture both dimensions effectively, 
achieving a normalized DTW score of 0.49, which is a 91.4% improvement over traditional Transformer models on the same dataset.

</p>

**Description:**
This project focuses on building a database for an online bike shop. 
The MySQL database is connected to the shop's website to process real-time transactions. 
In addition, I performed data analytics and machine learning by extracting features from this dataset 
to generate recommendations for optimizing business solutions.
